The flight was delayed for hours, and the airline staff was unhelpful and rude. The hotel staff was rude and unhelpful. The hotel staff was unprofessional, and the room was not clean. Worst hotel experience ever! The staff was rude, and the room was dirty. The hotel charged extra for everything, and the service was still bad.
