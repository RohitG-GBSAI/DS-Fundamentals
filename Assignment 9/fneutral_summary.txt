The flight experience was average, nothing special but also nothing bad. The flight had average service, nothing bad, but nothing to highlight. The flight was on time, and the service was adequate but nothing memorable. The flight was decent, though there was nothing exceptional about the service. The room was fine, but nothing stood out. The room had bedbugs, and the hotel staff was unhelpful in addressing the issue.
