Everything about the trip was incredible, from the beautiful hotel to the friendly staff. The trip was fantastic, the guide knew all the best spots and gave great recommendations. The hotel offered good service, but the atmosphere wasnâ€™t as lively as expected. This airline is always reliable, on time, and provides great service. The hotel met basic needs but lacked any wow factor. Had a great time at this hotel.
